# 2048-CPP

### A replica of the 2048 android game.

#### Made by [Govind Balaji S](https://github.com/govindbalaji-s) and [Harshan Baskar](https://github.com/Harshan01)  

This repository holds the code for the purpose of Computer Science Project by Govind Balaji S. and Harshan Baskar for CBSE HSC board exam.  
### Project Description  
The game itself is difficult to explain, but you can always try the actual game on android.  
 

Since we must use the severely out-dated turboC++(1991-1998) for this project, and the BGI graphics framework is buggy and unstable, we had to restrict to ASCII art. If you can improve the ascii art better, contact any of the two of us to become a contributor. Below are some screenshots from the game.
